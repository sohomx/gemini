### Usage

This Python script shows how to use Google's GenerativeAI API to:

- Generate Text: Ask questions or provide prompts to generate text responses.
- Analyze Images: Understand and generate content based on the provided images.

### Steps:

1. Text Generation:

Create a model for text generation.
Ask questions like "What is machine learning?" and get AI-generated responses.
Convert the AI-generated text for better readability.

2. Image Analysis:

Load an image using the script.
Use a vision model to analyze the image and generate AI-driven insights.
Convert the generated analysis into readable text.

3. Generate Test Cases:

Generate test cases by providing both text instructions and an image.
Get AI-generated test cases based on the given scenario and visual input.

### Code Functionality

This script utilizes Google's GenerativeAI API to interact with pretrained models:

- It asks questions, processes text, and understands images by leveraging AI capabilities.
- The code uses specific methods to generate content based on the provided prompts or images.
- It's designed to demonstrate the AI's ability to generate text and analyze images for various scenarios.
